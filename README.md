# Fraud Detection

Is an app you can see different heart beating monitors.

You take a mesure each monitors take mesures in a different way and there payload is different as well.

I built the backend with python Django available [here](https://github.com/steven3092/fraud_detection_backend)

Enjoy !

The first time

and then

# The tests


To run the test you have to run

Here I use Vitest to simulate the DOM because it works more easily with Vite than Jest.
